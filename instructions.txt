If you get an error like error while loading shared libraries: libtls.so.20: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Run your bashrc and it should be fixed


SETUP S3 BUCKET
Make sure you have a iam_role specified in EC2 instructions with access to S3

go to S3

create bucket named: teamsocket-<name>

In home directory, mkdir socket-html

s3fs <bucket-name> socket-html/ -o iam_role="spinarak-<name>"

To test your s3 mounting, cd socket-html/; echo hurray > test.txt

Check your S3 console to see if the file has uploaded. Make sure you have refreshed the page.
